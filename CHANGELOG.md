## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **M0 Foundations** (#1–#7, #167):
  - Backend scaffold: FastAPI app factory, `LORE_*` settings, `lore` CLI (`serve`, `openapi`),
    `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/meta`, structured logging with request ids.
  - HTTP hardening: Host allowlist, mutation guard (`X-Lore-Client`, `Origin`), security headers
    and CSP, request size limits, problem+json errors.
  - Frontend workspaces: `@lore/web` SPA shell (React, TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind, shadcn)
    and the `@lore/chronology` package skeleton.
  - API contract pipeline: OpenAPI → generated TypeScript types, typed client, drift check.
  - Makefile entry point, dev orchestration (`make dev`), GitHub Actions CI (backend, frontend,
    contract, chronology, e2e, docker) and Dependabot.
  - Multi-stage Docker image and `docker-compose.yml` (author instance on `127.0.0.1:8080`).
- **M1 Chronology engine** (#8–#29):
  - The time engine in Python (`lore.chronology`) and TypeScript (`@lore/chronology`), sharing one
    spec, exported JSON Schemas and conformance vectors that both engines pass.
  - Calendars: definition validation and compilation, moment ⇄ fields conversions, unit bounds,
    ordinals and picker options, parallel cycles (weeks), intercalary units, eras, regimes
    (calendar reforms) and local anchors, astronomical overlays (moons, seasons).
  - Calendar arithmetic (add with constrain/reject, diff by largest unit) and formatting
    (patterns, defaults, intercalary formats, spans, large numbers).
  - Calendar preset library with base-unit scaling.
  - Recurrence rules: intervals, calendar rules, filters and selectors, cycle frequencies,
    counts, exclusions, occurrence numbers and window expansion without bulk storage.
  - Correspondence mapping between dimensions.
  - Timeline viewport math, calendar-aware ticks and tiles.
  - Cross-engine differential fuzzing (`make test-differential`) and benchmarks (`make bench`).
